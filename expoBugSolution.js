The solution is highly context-dependent.  If the issue originates within the application code, debugging and addressing the underlying problem is necessary.  However, if the error is within Expo CLI, there's no direct fix within the application.  The ideal solution would be improved error reporting from Expo CLI itself.  The provided solution focuses on demonstrating potential approaches, rather than offering a guaranteed fix because the root cause isn't known. In this `expoBugSolution.js`, we would aim to improve error handling and logging to provide more diagnostic detail to users.  This might involve checking for more specific conditions and providing detailed console messages.  In cases where we can't resolve the root cause, the goal is to provide a helpful message to the user, leading to more effective debugging.
