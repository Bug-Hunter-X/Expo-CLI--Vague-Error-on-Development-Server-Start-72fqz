# Expo CLI: Vague Development Server Error

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo CLI development server fails to start, providing insufficient error messages to identify the root cause.

## Problem Description

Intermittently, the `expo start` command fails without clear diagnostic information. The error message is often generic and unhelpful, making it difficult to determine the cause of the failure and implement a solution.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Observe the error message in the terminal.  The exact error varies, but it's typically not descriptive enough for debugging.

## Expected Behavior

The Expo CLI should start the development server and provide a more informative error message when something goes wrong.

## Actual Behavior

The Expo CLI fails to start the development server with an unclear error message, hindering the development process.

## Solution

The solution, as demonstrated in `expoBugSolution.js`, involves implementing more comprehensive error handling within the Expo CLI process or within the application's code itself (if the error is application-specific).  However, in many instances the problem lies outside the developer's control (expo cli bug) thus requiring more robust error messages from Expo CLI itself.
